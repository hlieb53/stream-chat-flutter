Understanding Setup For stream_chat_flutter

### Add pub.dev dependency

First, you need to add the `stream_chat_flutter` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`.

You can either run this command:

```
flutter pub add stream_chat_flutter
```

OR

Add this line in the dependencies section of your pubspec.yaml after substituting latest version:

```
dependencies:
  stream_chat_flutter_core: ^latest_version
```

### Details On Platform Support

`stream_chat_flutter` was originally created for Android and iOS mobile platforms. As Flutter matured,
additional platforms were added and the package now has experimental support for web and desktop as
[detailed here](https://getstream.io/blog/announcing-experimental-multi-platform-support-for-the-stream-flutter-sdk/).

However, platforms other than mobile may have additional constraints due to not supporting all plugins,
which will be addressed by the respective plugin creators over time.

### Setup: iOS

The library uses [flutter file picker plugin](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker) to pick files from the os.
Follow [this wiki](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/wiki/Setup#ios) to fulfill iOS requirements.

We also use [video_player](https://pub.dev/packages/video_player) to reproduce videos.
Follow [this guide](https://pub.dev/packages/video_player#installation) to fulfill the requirements.

To pick images from the camera, we use the [image_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker) plugin.
Follow [these instructions](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker#ios) to check the requirements.

### Setup: Web

Due to Moor web (for offline storage) you need to include the sql.js library:

```
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <script defer src="sql-wasm.js"></script>
    <script defer src="main.dart.js" type="application/javascript"></script>
</head>
<body></body>
</html>
```

You can grab the latest version of sql-wasm.js and sql-wasm.wasm [here](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js/releases)
and copy them into your `/web` folder.
