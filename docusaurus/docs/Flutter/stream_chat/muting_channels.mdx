Muting Channels For Users

Messages added to a channel will not trigger push notifications, nor change the unread count for the users that muted it.

By default, mutes stay in place indefinitely until the user removes it; however, you can optionally set an expiration time.

The list of muted channels and their expiration time is returned when the user connects.

### Channel Mute

```dart
// mute channel for current user
await channel.mute();

// mute a channel for 2 weeks
await channel.mute(expiration: Duration(days: 15));

// mute a channel for 10 seconds
await channel.mute(expiration: Duration(seconds: 10));

// check if channel is muted
channel.isMuted;
```

### Query Muted Channels

Muted channels can be filtered or excluded by using the `muted` in your query channels filter.

```dart
// retrieve all channels excluding muted ones
await client.queryChannels(
    filter: {
      'members': {
        r'$in': [userId],
      },
      'muted': false,
    }
  );

// retrieve all muted channels
await client.queryChannels(
    filter: {
      'muted': true,
    }
  );
```

### Remove a Channel Mute

Whenever you need to unmute, you are able to.

```dart
// unmute channel for current user
await channel.unmute();

// unmute channel for a user (server-side)
await channel.unmute({ user_id: userId });
```
