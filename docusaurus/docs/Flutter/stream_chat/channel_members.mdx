### Adding & Removing Channel Members

Using the addMembers() method adds the given users as members, while removeMembers() removes them.

```dart
await channel.addMembers(["thierry", "josh"]);
await channel.removeMembers(["tommaso"]);
```

You can optionally include a message object that client-side SDKs will use to populate a system message.
This works for both add and remove members:

```dart
// using client-side client
await channel.addMembers(['tommaso'], Message(text: 'Tommaso joined'));
```

### Leaving a channel

It is possible for user to leave the channel without moderator-level permissions.
Make sure channel members have `RemoveOwnChannelMembership` permission.

```dart
// remove own channel membership
await channel.removeMembers(['my_user_id']);
```
