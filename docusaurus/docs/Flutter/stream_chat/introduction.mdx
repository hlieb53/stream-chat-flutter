Exploring the Basics of the stream_chat package (LLC)

<h2> Official Dart Client for Stream Chat </h2>

The official Dart client for Stream Chat, a service for building chat applications.
This library can be used on any Dart project and on both mobile and web apps with Flutter.

The Low Level Client ([stream_chat]('https://pub.dev/packages/stream_chat')) provides the basic
bindings for integrating Stream Chat into your Flutter app with the ability to connect users,
listening to events, send and receive messages, channel CRUD operations, etc.
This allows you to control and customise your interface completely while using the
Stream Chat backend.

Check out our Core package ([stream_chat_flutter_core]('https://pub.dev/packages/stream_chat_flutter_core'))
for easier implementations of common uses such as retrieving channels,
retrieving channel message lists, seraching for messages, etc.

This section goes into detail on using the LLC and various things you can achieve using it.
