title: Silent Messages

Sometimes you want to add system or transactional messages to channels such as: "your ride is waiting for you",
"James updated the information for the trip", "You and Jane are now matched" and so on.

You may not want these messages to mark a channel as unread or increase the unread messages for users.

Silent messages are special messages that don't increase the unread messages count nor mark a channel as unread.
Creating a silent message is very simple, you only need to include the silent field boolean field and set it to true.

```dart
final text = 'You completed your trip';

const message = {

    text: text,

    user: systemUser,

    silent: true,

    attachments: tripAttachments,

};
await channel.sendMessage(message);
```

<b>Notes: </b>

1.  Existing messages cannot be turned into a silent message or vice versa.

2.  Silent messages do send push notifications by default. To skip our push notification service,
mark the message with `skip_push: true`.
