Remove Channels By Deleting Or Hiding

### Deleting a Channel

You can delete a Channel using the delete method. This marks the channel as deleted and hides all the content.

```dart
await channel.delete();
```

Note: If you recreate this channel, it will show up empty. Recovering old messages is not currently supported via the Stream Chat API.

### Hiding a Channel

Hiding a channel will remove it from query channel requests for that user until a new message is added.
Please keep in mind that hiding a channel is only available to members of that channel.

Optionally you can also clear the entire message history of that channel for the user.
This way, when a new message is received, it will be the only one present in the channel.

```dart
// hides the channel until a new message is added there
await channel.hide();

// shows a previously hidden channel
await channel.show();

// hide the channel and clear the message history
await channel.hide(clearHistory: true);
```

Note: You can still retrieve the list of hidden channels using the { "hidden" : true } query parameter.
