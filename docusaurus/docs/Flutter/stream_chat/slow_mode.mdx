Using Slow Mode For Reduced Message Traffic

Slow mode helps reduce noise on a channel by limiting users to a maximum of 1 message per cooldown interval.

The cooldown interval is configurable and can be anything between 1 and 120 seconds. For instance, if you enable slow mode and set the cooldown interval to 30 seconds a user will be able to post at most 1 message every 30 seconds.

Moderators, admins and server-side API calls are not restricted by the cooldown period and can post messages as usual.
Slow mode is disabled by default and can be enabled/disabled by admins and moderators.

<b>Note:</b> SLOW MODE is in the works for the Flutter SDK
