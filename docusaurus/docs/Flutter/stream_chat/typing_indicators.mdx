All official SDKs support typing events out of the box and are handled on all channels with the typing_events featured enabled.
Typing indicators allow you to show to users who is currently typing in the channel.
This feature can be switched on/off on a channel-type basis using the CLI or directly from the Dashboard.
If you are using one of the official SDK libraries, you will only need to ensure that typing indicators are enabled to get this working.

If you are building your UI on top of one of our Chat Clients instead, you will need to take care of four things:

Send an event `typing.start` when the user starts typing
Send an event `typing.stop` after the user stopped typing
Handle the two events and use them to toggle the typing indicator UI
Use `parent_id` field of the event to indicate that typing is happening in a thread

### Sending start and stop typing events

```dart
// The Dart client keeps track of the typing state for you.
// Just call `channel.keystroke()` when the user types and
// `channel.stopTyping()` when the user sends the message (or aborts)

// sends a typing.start event at most once every two seconds
await channel.keystroke();

// sends a typing.start event for a particular thread
await channel.keystroke(thread_id);

// sends the typing.stop event
await channel.stopTyping();
```

When sending events on user input, you should make sure to follow some best-practices to avoid bugs.

Only send typing.start when the user starts typing
Send typing.stop after a few seconds since the last keystroke

### Receiving typing indicator events

```dart
// channels keep track of the users that are currently typing
// the `channel.state.typingEvents` is an immutable object which gets regenerated
// every time a new user is added or removed to this list
print(channel.state.typingEvents);

// add typing start event handling
channel.on('typing.start', (event) => {
  print('${event.user.name} started typing');
});

// add typing stop event handling
channel.on('typing.stop', event => {
  print('${event.user.name} stopped typing');
});
```

Because clients might fail at sending `typing.stop` event all Chat clients periodically prune the list of typing users.
