Understanding Filters

### Introduction

Filters are used to get a specific subset of objects (channels, users, messages, members, etc) which
fit the conditions specified. Earlier versions of the SDK contained String-based filters which are now replaced by type-safe
filters. This guide aims to explain the different types of filters and how to use them.
