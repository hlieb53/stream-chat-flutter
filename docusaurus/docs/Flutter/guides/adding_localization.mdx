Adding Localization To UI Widgets

### Introduction

We have a dedicated package for adding localization to our UI widgets. It's called `stream_chat_localizations` and you can find it [here](https://pub.dev/packages/stream_chat_localizations).

### Supported languages

At the moment we support the following languages:
- [English](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-flutter/blob/master/packages/stream_chat_localizations/lib/src/stream_chat_localizations_en.dart)
- [Hindi](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-flutter/blob/master/packages/stream_chat_localizations/lib/src/stream_chat_localizations_hi.dart)
- [Italian](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-flutter/blob/master/packages/stream_chat_localizations/lib/src/stream_chat_localizations_it.dart)
- [French](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-flutter/blob/master/packages/stream_chat_localizations/lib/src/stream_chat_localizations_fr.dart)

More languages will be added in the future. Feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-flutter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to add more languages.

### Add dependency

Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file, use the latest version [![Pub](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/stream_chat_localizations.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/stream_chat_localizations)
```yaml
dependencies:
 stream_chat_localizations: ^latest_version
```

You should then run `flutter packages get`

### Usage

Flutter generally and the Stream Chat SDK will use the system locale of the users device, if that locale is supported (see below), if the locale is not supported we will default to `en`.
Make sure to read more about localization in the [official Flutter docs](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization).

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stream_chat_localizations/stream_chat_localizations.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      // Add all the supported locales
      supportedLocales: const [
        Locale('en'),
        Locale('hi'),
        Locale('fr'),
        Locale('it'),
      ],
      // Add GlobalStreamChatLocalizations.delegates
      localizationsDelegates: GlobalStreamChatLocalizations.delegates,
      builder: (context, widget) => StreamChat(
        client: client,
        child: widget,
      ),
      home: StreamChannel(
        channel: channel,
        child: const ChannelPage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Adding a new language

To add a new language, create a new class extending `GlobalStreamChatLocalizations` and create a delegate for it, adding it to the `delegates` array.

Checkout [this example](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-flutter/blob/master/packages/stream_chat_localizations/example/lib/add_new_lang.dart) to see how to add a new language.

### Override exisiting languages

To override an existing language, create a new class extending that particular language class and create a delegate for it, adding it to the `delegates` array.

Checkout [this example](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-flutter/blob/master/packages/stream_chat_localizations/example/lib/override_lang.dart) to see how to override an existing language.

### Changing the default language

To change the default language you can use the `MaterialApp.localeListResolutionCallback` property.
Here is an example of how that would look like:

```dart
    MaterialApp(
        theme: ThemeData.light(),
        darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(),
        // Add all the supported locales
        supportedLocales: const [
            Locale('en'),
            Locale('hi'),
            Locale('fr'),
            Locale('it'),
        ],
        localeListResolutionCallback: (locales, supportedLocales) {
            final supportedLanguageCodes =
                supportedLocales.map((e) => e.languageCode);
            if (locales != null) {
            for (final locale in locales) {
                if (supportedLanguageCodes.contains(locale.languageCode)) {
                return locale;
                }
            }
            }

            return const Locale('it');
        },
        // Add GlobalStreamChatLocalizations.delegates
        localizationsDelegates: GlobalStreamChatLocalizations.delegates,
        ...

```

In this case we're using Italian as the default language.

### ⚠️ Note on **iOS**

For translation to work on **iOS** you need to add supported locales to 
`ios/Runner/Info.plist` as described [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization#specifying-supportedlocales).

Example:

```xml
<key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
<array>
	<string>en</string>
	<string>nb</string>
	<string>fr</string>
	<string>it</string>
</array>
```
