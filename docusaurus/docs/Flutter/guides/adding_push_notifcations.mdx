Adding Push Notifications To Your Application

### Introduction

Push notifications are a core part of the experience for a messaging app. Users often need to be notified
of new messages and old notifications sometimes need to be updated silently as well.

This guide details how to add push notifications to your app.

### Configure APN

Stream Chat supports push for both Android and iOS.

In this section you will find all information on how to configure push for APN and Firebase.

Only new messages are pushed to mobile devices, all other chat events are only send to WebSocket clients and webhook endpoints if configured.

#### Push Delivery Logic

Push message delivery follows the following logic:

* Only channel members can receive push messages
* Members that are currently online do not receive push messages
* Messages added within a thread are only sent to users that are part of that thread (they posted at least one message or were mentioned)
* Messages from muted users are not sent
* Messages are sent to all registered devices for a user (up to 25)
* Don't try to register devices for anonymous users (API will ignore but will eat from rate limit budget)
* Up to 100 members of a channel will receive push notifications
* skip_push is not marked as true, as described here.
* push_notifications is enabled (default) on the channel type for message is sent.
