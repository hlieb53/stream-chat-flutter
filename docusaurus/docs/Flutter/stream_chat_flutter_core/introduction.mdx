This package provides business logic to fetch common things required for integrating Stream Chat into your application.
The core package allows more customisation and hence provides business logic but no UI components.
Please use the stream_chat_flutter package for the full fledged suite of UI components or stream_chat for the low-level client.

The package primarily contains three types of classes:

* Business Logic Components
* Core Components
* Core Controllers

### Business Logic Components

These components allow you to have the maximum and lower-level control of the queries being executed.

The BLoCs we provide are:

* ChannelsBloc
* MessageSearchBloc
* UsersBloc

### Core Components

Core components usually are an easy way to fetch data associated with Stream Chat which are decoupled from UI and often expose UI builders. Data fetching can be controlled with the controllers of the respective core components.

* ChannelListCore (Fetch a list of channels)
* MessageListCore (Fetch a list of messages from a channel)
* MessageSearchListCore (Fetch a list of search messages)
* UserListCore (Fetch a list of users)
* StreamChatCore (This is different from the other core components - it is a version of StreamChat decoupled from theme and initialisations.)

### Core Controllers

Core Controllers are supplied to respective CoreList widgets which allows reloading and pagination of data whenever needed.

* ChannelListController
* MessageListController
* MessageSearchListController
* ChannelListController

This section goes into the individual core package widgets and their functional use.
