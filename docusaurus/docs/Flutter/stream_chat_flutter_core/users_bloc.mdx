Widget dedicated to the management of a users list with pagination.

`UsersBloc` can be accessed at anytime by using the static `.of` method
using Flutter's `BuildContext`.

```dart
var _userBloc_ = UsersBloc.of(context);
```

The `UsersBloc` widget encapsulates common functionality related to user lists and also supplies them down the widget tree.

Here is a basic implementation of `UsersBloc`:

```dart
UsersBloc(
    child: // Further Widget Tree
),
```
