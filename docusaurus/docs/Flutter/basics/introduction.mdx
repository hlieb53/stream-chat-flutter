![](../assets/sdk_title.png)

Stream Chat allows you to build real-time chat messaging in less time.
Rapidly ship in-app messaging with our highly reliable chat infrastructure and feature-rich SDKs.
Drive in-app conversion, engagement, and retention.

The Flutter SDK enables you to build any type of chat or messaging experience for Android, iOS, Web
and Desktop.

This section of the documentation focuses on our Flutter SDK which helps you easily
ship high quality messaging experiences in apps and programs built with the [Flutter toolkit made
by Google](https://flutter.dev).

The Stream Chat Flutter SDK comprises of four different packages to choose from ranging from ones
giving you complete control to ones that give you a rich out-of-the-box chat experience.

The packages that make up the Stream Chat SDK are:

1. <b>Low Level Client (stream_chat)</b> : A pure Dart package that can be used on any Dart project.
It provides a low-level client to access the Stream Chat service.
2. <b>Core (stream_chat_flutter_core)</b> : Provides business logic to fetch common things required
for integrating Stream Chat into your application.
The core package allows more customisation and hence provides business logic but no UI components.
3. <b>UI (stream_chat_flutter)</b> : This library includes both a low-level chat SDK and a set of
reusable and customisable UI components.
4. <b>Persistence (stream_chat_persistence)</b> : Provides a persistence client for fetching and
saving chat data locally.

We recommend building prototypes using the full UI package since it contains UI widgets already
integrated with Stream's API. [stream_chat_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/stream_chat_flutter)
is the fastest way to get up and running using Stream chat in your app.

If you're building a very custom UI and would prefer a more lean package,
our core package will be suited to this use case. Core allows you to build custom,
expressive UIs while retaining the benefits of our full Flutter SDK.
APIs for accessing and controlling users, sending messages, etc are seamlessly integrated into
this package and accessible via providers and builders.

Before reading the docs, consider trying our [online API tour](https://getstream.io/chat/get_started/),
it is a nice way to learn how the API works.
It's in-browser so Javascript-based but the ideas are pretty much the same as Dart.

You may also like to look at the [Flutter tutorial](https://getstream.io/chat/flutter/tutorial/)
which focuses on using the UI package to get Stream Chat integrated into a Flutter app.

Further sections break down each individual packages and explain several common operations.
